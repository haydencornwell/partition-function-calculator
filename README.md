# Partition Function Calculator

This program calculates the value of the partition function at a user-defined range of temperature points as well as the probability that a particle will be in each state defined in the partition function at each point.

In order to compile this program, the Boost.Multiprecision and MPIR libaries must be installed and linked using the C++11 standard (-lmpfr -std=c++11 for g++).
